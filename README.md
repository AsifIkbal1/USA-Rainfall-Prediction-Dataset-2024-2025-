## Overview

This repository contains a dataset specifically curated for rainfall prediction in the USA from 2024 to 2025. It includes various meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation levels.

This dataset is intended to help data scientists, researchers, and meteorologists build predictive models to anticipate rainfall patterns in real-time.

## Dataset Description

The **USA Rainfall Prediction Dataset (2024-2025)** includes:
- **Timeframe**: January 2024 to December 2025
- **Geographical Scope**: All 50 U.S. states
- **Attributes**: 
  - Date and time
  - Geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude)
  - Precipitation (in mm)
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Wind speed (m/s)
  - Barometric pressure (hPa)
  
The dataset is available in CSV format and can be easily loaded into Python, R, or other data analysis platforms.

## Data Sources

The dataset aggregates data from multiple publicly available sources including:
- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
- NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission
- Local weather stations and meteorological services

## Usage

1. **Download the dataset**: You can download the dataset from the `data/` directory.
2. **Explore the data**: Use Python (Pandas), R, or any other tools for data analysis.
3. **Build predictive models**: This dataset is ideal for machine learning models such as regression, decision trees, and neural networks for rainfall prediction.

Sample code to load the dataset using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_dataset.csv')

# Display the first few rows
data.head()
```
